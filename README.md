# 8085-Time-delay-calculator
This program will provide you with step by step calculation for time delay calculation of 8085 microprocessor.                                                                     
You are required to paste this code in any cpp compiler.                                                                                                                           
After compiling, the program will ask to provide two inputs : Crystal frequency(MHZ) ,  Time delay(sec)                                                                             After providing the inputs, the step by step output will be generated at the terminal
